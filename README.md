# üß† Sudoku in COAL Assembly

A low-level implementation of the classic 9x9 Sudoku puzzle using **COAL (Computer Organization and Assembly Language)**. This project demonstrates how complex logic can be simulated using basic assembly-level instructions and memory addressing, typically taught in Computer Organization courses.
